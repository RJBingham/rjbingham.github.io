    "section": "Introduction to coordinate files",
    "text": "Introduction to coordinate files\nSeveral experimental structures (from NMR and X-ray crystallography) are available of bacterial peptides in complex with fibronectin. The structure files can be downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For example, see the “Crystal structure of the second and third fibronectin F1 modules in complex with a fragment of Streptococcus pyogenes SfbI-5”, PDB accession code 3ZRZ. Click on Download Files, then choose either the PDBx/mmCIF Format, or the Legacy PDB Format.\n\n\n\nscreenshot of the PDB)\n\n\nThis is a simple text file. Open it in a text editor (e.g. Wordpad) and scroll down to see the 3D coordinates of each atom. There are several programs available to visualise coordinate files in this format (PyMOL, VMD, RASMOL), but these will not be covered here.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages of using coordinates from experimental structures such as these. The primary advantage is the accuracy of the structure - we can have high confidence in the precise spatial arrangement of all atoms in the coordinate file. There are some things we need to aware of:\n\nloop regions may be disordered. The amino acids in these flexible regions are often missing in the coordinate files, therefore there is a break, or gap in the polypeptide.\nSome amino acids may have been modelled in two or more conformations (alternative conformations). Or, part of the side-chain might be missing.\nThe coordinate file (the asymmetric unit) may have more than one copy of the molecule.\n\nThe coordinate files will often contain other non-protein components. If you look at 3ZRZ above, you will see a glycerol molecule, a sulphate ion and many water molecules. In addition, the bacterial peptide is acetylated at the N-terminus (ACE residue)\n\nTo calculate an accurate binding affinity between two molecules, we need accurate coordinate files that include all the amino acids. These missing (or extra) parts will need to be corrected.\nOne option would be to edit the text file to remove these non-protein atoms, then rebuild and model the missing loops and side-chains. However, in 2021, Alphafold2 was released, which, for the first time made it possible to accurately predict the 3D-structure of a protein based only on the amino acid sequence (Jumper et al., 2021). The accuracy of these protein models has been shown to be excellent, especially where there is a prior structure in the PDB with high sequence identity to the target. Then, in 2024 Alphafold3 was released (Abramson et al., 2024) allowing the accurate prediction of complexes, for example the interaction between two distinct proteins. The Alphafold server is available here. You will need a google account to use it. You will notice from this server that the input is simplly an amino acid sequence in one-letter code."
