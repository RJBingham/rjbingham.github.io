    "text": "This guide is written for project students at undergraduate or MSc level.\nThe aim is to extract the amino acid sequences for the target proteins, build an Alphafold model of the complex, then submit this to PRODIGY to estimate the binding affinity. We start with an introduction to coordinate files. ## Introduction to coordinate files\nSeveral experimental structures (from NMR and X-ray crystallography) are available of bacterial peptides in complex with fibronectin. The structure files can be downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For example, see the “Crystal structure of the second and third fibronectin F1 modules in complex with a fragment of Streptococcus pyogenes SfbI-5”, PDB accession code 3ZRZ. Click on Download Files, then choose either the PDBx/mmCIF Format, or the Legacy PDB Format.\nThis is a simple text file. Open it in a text editor (e.g. Wordpad) and scroll down to see the 3D coordinates of each atom. You will see this to specify the details for atom 1 of 3ZRZ.pdb\nReading across, the columns are:\nThere are several programs available to visualise coordinate files in this format (PyMOL, VMD, RASMOL), but these will not be covered here.\nThere are numerous advantages of using coordinate files from experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography. The primary advantage is the accuracy of the structure - we can have high confidence in the precise spatial arrangement of all atoms in the coordinate file. However, there are some things we need to aware of:\nTo calculate an accurate binding affinity between two molecules, we need accurate coordinate files that include all the amino acids. These missing (or extra) parts will need to be corrected.\nOne option would be to edit the text file to remove these non-protein atoms, then rebuild and model the missing loops and side-chains. However, in 2021, Alphafold2 was released, which, for the first time made it possible to accurately predict the 3D-structure of a protein based only on the amino acid sequence (Jumper et al., 2021). The accuracy of these protein models has been shown to be excellent, especially where there is a prior structure in the PDB with high sequence identity to the target. Then, in 2024 Alphafold3 was released (Abramson et al., 2024) allowing the accurate prediction of complexes, for example the interaction between two distinct proteins. The Alphafold server is available here. You will need a google account to use it. You will notice from this server that the input is simply an amino acid sequence in one-letter code."

The text file will remain unaltered. You can generate a new PDB file using PyMOL using File-Export Molecule, but you should always use a new filename.\n\n\nThere are numerous advantages of using coordinate files from experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography. The primary advantage is the accuracy of the structure - we can have high confidence in the precise spatial arrangement of all atoms in the coordinate file. However, there are some things we need to aware of:\n\nloop regions may be disordered. The amino acids in these flexible regions are often missing in the coordinate files, therefore there is a break, or gap in the polypeptide.\nSome amino acids may have been modelled in two or more conformations (alternative conformations). Or, part of the side-chain might be missing.\nThe coordinate file (the asymmetric unit) may have more than one copy of the molecule of interest. For example, there are six copies of the biological relevant unit in 2RL0. You can visualise these if you colour by chain in PyMOL. There are subtle differences between these six structures.\n\nThe coordinate files will often contain other non-protein components. If you look at 3ZRZ, you will see a glycerol molecule, a sulphate ion and many water molecules. In addition, the bacterial peptide is acetylated at the N-terminus (ACE residue)\n\nTo calculate an accurate binding affinity between two molecules, we need accurate coordinate files that include all the amino acids. These missing (or extra) parts will need to be corrected.\nOne option would be to edit the text file to remove these non-protein atoms, then rebuild and model the missing loops and side-chains.

    "text": "Calculating binding affinity using PRODIGY\nThe PRODIGY webserver accepts files in .pdb format. However, the output from the Alphafold server is a .cif coordinate file which has a slightly different format. One way to convert .cif to .pdb is to use PyMOL.\n\nAs above, download the results from Alphafold and extract the zip file. You should see 5 models with the .cif extension\nOpen one of the files in PyMOL.\nClick on File -&gt; Export Molecule\nOn the Selection, use the dropdown menu to choose the correct model\nClick Save\nType in a suitable name (ending in .pdb) and click Save\n\nNow, submitting this to PRODIGY is straightforward. Simply upload the pdb coordinate file and fill out the boxes with appropriate values then click ‘Submit PRODIGY’. Interactor 1 is fibronectin, (A) and Interactor 2 is the bacterial peptide (B).\nWithin minutes, you see a result similar to below.\n\n\n\nPRODIGY output\n\n\nThe experimental Kd value for this interaction is 4.8 ±0.6 nM (Meenan et al., 2007). However, the value from PRODIDGY is only 0.0000039 nM. (PRODIGY reports a value in moles/L so mulitiply the value above by 10^9 to convert 3.9e-15 M to 3.9e-6 nM) Why is there such a large discrepancy? The value from PRODIGY is over 1 million times smaller than the experimentally measured value. To answer this, you need to consider the dynamics of this particular type of protein-protein interaction and the limitations of the PRODIGY method (see the PRODIGY publications). The bacterial peptide transitions from being disordered in the unbound state to an extended beta-strand in the bound state. Compare this scenario to the training set of protein-protein complexes used to develop PRODIGY."

To pursue this interest, I studied for a PhD in X-ray crystallography at the Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds under the supervision of Prof. Simon Phillips. I then worked as a postdoctoral research fellow under the supervision of Prof. Steve Homans and Prof. Steve Baldwin. By studying how a range of small molecules bind to the hydrophobic pocket of a small protein, we were able to demonstrate that non-polar protein-ligand interactions can be enthalpy driven with a significant contribution from London dispersion forces.\nIn 2006, I started a postdoctoral position at the University of York work under the supervision of Prof. Jennifer Potts investigating fibronectin-binding proteins from pathogenic bacteria, elucidating mechanisms of the tandem beta-zipper interaction.\nI joined the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Huddersfield in September 2008."

    "text": "Extracting the amino acid sequences\nIn order to generate Alphafold models, we need to extract the correct amino acid sequences of the target proteins. In the example, we will find the amino acid sequences that correspond to the interaction between two different bacterial peptides (SfbI and FnBPA1) and the 2nd and 3rd F1 domains of human fibronectin (2F1-5F1).\n\nStaphylococcus aureus Fibronectin-binding Protein A Repeat 1 (FnBPA-1)\nFnBPA is a bacterial peptide from Staphylococcus aureus with 11 Fn-binding repeats. The interaction between FnBPA and fibronectin is descibed in Meenan et al, 2007.\nNotice from Table 1 in Meenan et al, that FnBPA-1 corresponds to residues 512-550. Go to the uniprot entry for FnBPA P14738, find the amino acids 512-550, and paste them into a text file, as below.\n&gt;FnBPA1(512-550)\nGPIIQNNKFEYKEDTIKETLTGQYDKNLVTTVEEEYDSS\nNotice that this is identical to the amino acid sequence for FnBPA1 in Figure 1, part B.\n\n\nStreptococcal fibronectin-binding protein I (SfbI)\nSfbI is bacterial peptide from Streptococcus pyogenes. The intereaction between SfBI and fibronectin is described in Schwarz-Linek et al., (2003). The five repeats of SfBI are numbered 1-5 (top of Figure 3). In this example, we are interested in the interaction between 2F1-3F1 and repeat number 5. On Figure 3 you can see that the researchers have measured the binding affinity for 3 fragments of SfbI-5. The middle one with the sequence TGMSGFSETVTIVEDTRP binds to 2F1-3F1 with a measured binding affinity of 3.6 micromolar. The figure is an image, so we cannot cut and paste this peptide sequence from here. Typing it out is error-prone and time consuming. If you search the uniprotKB for SfbI. You will see many entries from different isolates, many of which will have sequence variations from what was experimentally measured in Schwarz-Linek et al., (2003). I could not find SfbI in the reference proteome on Uniprot, possibly because the protein is annotated with a different name. Instead, we will search the NCBI. Type “SfbI” in to the search box, then select “RefSeq” on the left side to only show sequences for reference proteomes:\n\n\nThe top hit is Fibronectin-binding protein PrtF1/SfbI from Streptococcus pyogenes.

You can use Control-F, but be aware of the spaces. Below you can see the region of SfbI-5 that binds to 2F1-3F1 (TGMSGFSETVTIVEDTRP).  Copy this sequence and paste it into a text file.

Click on Family and Domains, then scroll down to find the 2nd type-I domain (2F1), this is called “Fibronectin type-I 2” and it is residues 95-138. Scroll down further to the 5th type-I domain (5F1), this is called “Fibronectin type-I 5” and it is residues 229-273. Therefore, 2F1-5F1 must be all of these residues 95-273.\nScroll down to the sequence section. Select residues 95-273, copy and paste the sequence into a text editor and give it a sensible filename.

    "text": "Generating a model of the tandem beta-zipper using AlphaFold3\nNow you have the amino acid sequences in one-letter code, it is straightforward to generate a 3D model of the protein-protein interaction. Go to the Alphafold server, paste in the sequence of fibronectin (2F1-5F1), click on “Add entity”, then paste in the corresponding sequence of the bacterial peptide (FnBPA1). Click on “Continue and preview job”. Once done, your completed jobs will appear as a list on the lower part of the screen. Click on the 3 dots on the right-side and download the results as a zip file. Extract the zip file, then look for the five models (the ones ending in .cif). You can visualise this in PyMOL. You should see something similar to the figure below.  Compare this model of FnBPA-1 interacting with 2F1-5F1 with the two X-ray crystal structures (separated by the dashed line) shown in Figure 1A in Bingham et al., (2008). Notice that the fold of the individual Fn domains is the same, but the relative orientation of the domains is slightly different. The relative orientation shown in the 2008 paper was estimated based on the superposition with other Fn typeI-typeI domain interactions. The orientation in the Alphafold model is likely to be more accurate (have higher occupancy). It is worth noting that extended multidomain systems such as this have a degree of flexibility, so the model we generate is just a snapshot of one possible orientation."

Open the structure in PyMOL and find residue Lys537 on Chain M. You should see that this resembles alanine. The side-chain of the Lys was not modelled because of disorder. It is necessary to rebuild these missing atoms. Click on the ‘Wizard’ menu to open the ‘Mutagenesis’ function. Pick the residue (Lys537 on Chain M), then on the menu at the bottom-right select ‘No mutation’, to bring up a list of amino acids. Choose ‘Lys’, then the words should change to ‘Mutate to Lys’, click ‘Apply’, then ‘Done’. Visually check that you have mutated this residue to lysine, then save the molecule in PDB format with the filename ‘2RKZ_model1.pdb’. Also, notice that the N-terminus of chain M is acetylated.\nOpen ‘2RKZ_model1.pdb’ in a text editor, delete everything except chains A and M.

The starting structure should be stable, so that as we run the individual umbrella simulations, there should not be any major conformational changes occurring. The changes in free energy we measure will be dominated by the separation of the bacterial peptide from the fibronectin. The first stage is to increase the box size."
