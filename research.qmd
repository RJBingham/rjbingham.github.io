I first developed an interest in structural molecular biology during my undergraduate degree at the University of Sheffield. To pursue this interest, I studied for a PhD in X-ray crystallography at the Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds under the supervision of Prof. Simon Phillips. I then worked as a postdoctoral research fellow under the supervision of Prof. Steve Homans and Prof. Steve Baldwin. By studying how a range of small molecules bind to the hydrophobic pocket of a small protein, we were able to demonstrate that non-polar protein-ligand interactions can be enthalpy driven with a significant contribution from London dispersion forces.

In 2006, I started a postdoctoral position at the University of York work under the supervision of Prof. Jennifer Potts investigating fibronectin-binding proteins from pathogenic bacteria, elucidating mechanisms of the tandem beta-zipper interaction.

I joined the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Huddersfield in September 2008.

## Current Projects and Tutorials
Since 2008, I have had the pleasure of supervising numerous undergraduate and postgraduate student projects.
I have a range of current projects in protein science, mainly focused on using computational techniques to aid our understanding of experimental results.

-   [Tutorial to calculate RMSD, TM-Score and GDT](homodimers.qmd)
-   [Tutorial to estimate the binding affinity of a tandem beta-zipper using PRODIGY](tandem_beta_prodigy.qmd)
-   [Umbrella Sampling](umbrella_sampling_tutorial.qmd)
